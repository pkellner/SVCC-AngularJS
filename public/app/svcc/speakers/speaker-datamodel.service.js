He'll define some common business scenarios, build out some tables, create relationships, and then demo usage, pitfalls, problems and design tradeoffs. With so many database-driven projects for consumer desktop software applications, websites and enterprise software systems, the database design plays a crucial role in the success of your project. You'll see real-life examples and issues such as: Creating a new table; Choosing data types; Normalization (and when to denormalize); Types of relationships; Referential integrity; Join/relationship tables; 1-to-many, many-to-many; How to actually use these structures in your application; While the examples will focus on SQL Server, the techniques and SQL code will work for virtually any SQL database. There will be discussion of various commercial and open source tools to streamline your work. ",

Many times, we engineers build features without ever talking to the customers and users who they benefit.\n\nWe'll start with the absolute basics: how to define your customer and discover what their true problem is. \"But I don't have any customers or users!\" you will say. You will learn how and where to find them and then how to engage them in meaningful conversation about their problems. Our goal? Build the right solution for the right customer and make them ultimately beg you for your solution.\n\nTeaching with examples, Mark will share his specific experiences finding customers and how to talk to them. We'll run through several tools, tips and tricks Mark used to find success (after years of failing).\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to learn nuggets of Lean Startup wisdom from one of the Bay Area's most enthusiastic trainers and mentors.",

First we will explore the fashion industry, as a system for producing and distributing clothing and accessories.  Then the speaker will cover aspects of modernization & globalization including eco-innovation, crowdsourcing and pre-tailing. This section will end by offering “insider hints” highlighting how to collaborate with a fashion company.\n\nSecond we will cover advanced technologies used to build wearable fashion with an overview of MEMS (motion, position, environmental and capture) sensors and wireless (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0) connectivity used to build wearable fashion with code samples (iOS & Android) capturing physiological data. We will review of the current wearable market (eg. Nike Fuelband, Shine, Lark, Fitbit, Bodybug & Google - Glass / Moto / Ara).  This section will provide a real world example of placing Bluetooth 4.0 connected MEMS devices into a shoe which will lead to some surprising capabilities (telling us how to exercise properly).  This section will conclude by exploring this final thought.   “If it looks amazing and does not work well people will forgive but if it works great and it is ugly, no one will wear it.”\n\nThe talk will culminate by showing how these two industries will co-evolve and the different forms these collaborations can take. Their growth will now come from radically new products that combine the best that these two industries can offer. \n",

This isn’t an introduction to testing or Jasmine or Angular or JavaScript. But you should be fine if you’re ready for adventure and willing to ask questions.",

MLLib leverages the memory-resident capabilities of Spark to enable fast implementations of iterative algorithms in ways that are not possible with traditional Map/Reduce on top of Hadoop. </p>\n\n<p>This talk will briefly describe the Spark Core and MLLib architectures and then switch focus into the Scala language implementation of examples in the following areas: Classification Regression Clustering (If time allows: Collaborative Filtering and Feature Selection) Additionally SparkSQL will be briefly discussed and then used to examine some of the results. </p>\n\n<p>This talk will assume working knowledge of scala functional programming methods and constructs.</p>",

However, this information is missing from many programming classes and textbooks and new Web apps are still repeating the mistakes of the past.

                            "description": "Time has proven that Agile development has provided huge gains for software development.  But what about organizations & teams that deliver a mixed-platform (Hardware/Software/Firmware) product to their customers?  Typically these companies have separate teams using different development processes - and it all has to fit together to deliver the best product to your customer.\n\nI see companies struggle with this issue, and many times miss schedule commitments and customer expectations.  With all the progress in the application of Agile methodologies to software development, we wondered what are the most effective tools in the Agile Software toolkit? Can these tools be applied to hardware and other types of product development programs? These questions were the focus of a 2013 study of Silicon Valley technology firms. \n\nOur research found that the most impactful elements of Agile/Scrum were not unique to software development!\n\nWe discovered key Best Practices and techniques for bridging the gap between Agile development programs and other types of program that include hardware or a mix of hardware and software. \n\nThis tutorial will 1) present select findings from the study; 2) discuss the aspects of agile that are easily applicable to hardware and other types of development programs; 3) present Best Practices for bridging Agile software programs with traditional hardware development in mixed product development projects.",

F# is a fantastic language - it mixes functional and Object Oriented approaches seamlessly, encourages writing bug-free code (it is virtually impossible to get a null exception...), comes with great features, and is incredibly productive. \nIn this talk, I will give a intro to F# for C# developers, illustrated with live code samples, and discuss where it fits and how you can get started with it!",

You will also learn about what it takes to receive and benefit from the MVP Award, and how to get started with the MVP Mentor program. Raucous (or at least mildly amusing) stories guaranteed.",

You've probably seen the shifting landscape of JavaScript frameworks, Backbone, Angular, Ember, etc. I'll be giving you an in-depth look at Ember. I'll briefly cover the advantages and disadvantages of Ember (comparative look, not a flame war) and then we'll dive into some awesome code (hello world, explain file structure, explaining resources to help you after my presentation, etc).\n\nFront ends can do marvelous things now a days, from caching, fully featured Data Access Layers, and data binding (single source of truth on the model, and templates/views that automagically stay up to date). Let's have some fun, I hope you join me on this guided adventure through EmberJS!",

Though the technical inflection may appear to be slight, building and deploying these systems affects everything - from system architectures, design principles, programming models all the way through to software deployment and maintenance.\n\nThis talk goes into some of the common design patterns and practices that can be used to develop and deploy distributed system.

While our server side is in Java, and our clients are in JavaScript (both browser and node.js) and ActionScript, the paradigms we use are in no way bound to these technology choices.\n\nWe use a language-neutral definition of all object types (including data types allowed for each property) which is used to generate object type definitions in each language environment. We then provide a \"notification system\" which pushes changes to all objects and collections of objects to any interested client. The overhead to detect changes on the server is small, and all clients are up to date with changes on the server without needing to flood the server unnecessary \"pulls\".\nCome learn about the pieces of technology we use to accomplish this, and understand how you could leverage these ideas in your own environment. Our JavaScript library, dxCore (built on top of BackBone.js), will be the primary client example we talk about.",

Specifically, we will be looking at examples where Fusion was employed to simplify library interfaces, provide declarative user experiences, and create efficient and non-intrusive type handling.\n\nAttendees will walk away with a working understanding of Boost.Fusion and several practical usage patterns. Come and learn how to integrate into your own source the library that labors behind the scene in Boost.Spirit, Boost.Xpressive, Boost.Geometry, Boost.Accumulators, odeint, Boost.Proto, Boost.Phoenix, and Boost.MSM.",

Then you need to learn about managed data services in Bluemix.  We will show how IBM Bluemix, an open-standards, cloud-based developer platform for building, deploying and managing apps can be leveraged for rapid application development on the cloud built on top of enterprise-level data services.  We will discuss and demo two such Bluemix services, SQL Database and Analytics Warehouse.  SQL Database adds an on-demand relational database to your Bluemix hosted application.  Powered by DB2, it provides a managed database service to handle demanding web and transactional workloads.  Analytics Warehouse service can be used for predictive analytics which can be applied to many areas including business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) areas, such as customer acquisition, retention, and winback. These analytics can be applied to technical tasks, such as predictive maintenance.  We will discuss how can we leverage analytics service in the cloud to provide the statistical analysis capability of R by using sample data sets that are stored in the BLU Acceleration for Cloud database.  Join us to get hands on and learn how to use SQLDB, AWH, and In-database R capability in the cloud. You will also learn to pump-in NOSQL document datasets into the warehouse for predictive analytics.",

This talk will take an intimate look at two of today’s most popular frameworks, Angular and Backbone and explore their differences.  We’ll show how Apache Cordova opens the world of mobile app development to web developers. In the session, we will demonstrate a “To Do” app using Angular and Backbone, with access to native device capabilities. We’ll compare the frameworks when transported to the world of mobile app development. Along the way, you'll also learn what kind of apps are best-suited for the hybrid architecture and when to make the switch from web app to mobile app.",

Fortunately, with the new JavaFX ZombieTime app, powered by the JSR 310 Date and Time API, you can rest easy.  With built-in time zone and DST support you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun.  Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations.  And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants.  With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\n\nThis presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our \"guests\".  You may also learn some JavaFX in the process -- that is entirely my fault.  Any correlation between the characters and events in this presentation and the impending extinction of mankind is purely coincidental.",

Ok, so maybe not all of those describe your average hacker (unless your pair programmer partner happens to be Penny), but we are going to try to put on the most spectacular magic show that has ever been seen on the stage at a tech conference! [geeks only]\n\nAs proper geeks, we are going to make heavy use of embedded wearable and internet connected devices to make up for our lack of dexterity and supernatural powers.  Also, all tricks will be revealed with the designs available to reproduce in the spirit of open source and creative commons.  Come join us to see for yourself what real [hacker] magic looks like!",

In this session we will be using the Java programming language to write simple algorithms that power windmills, drive cars, and draw pictures.  Students will get a chance to build projects from scratch with Lego bricks, deploy and run Java on the Mindstorms Intelligent Brick, and edit Java code on their laptops to make improvements to the projects.  Lego Mindstorms hardware will be supplied for use during the lab; however, students will receive a printed project guide and are encouraged to continue exploring and learning at home.",

                            "description": "Python is an agile object-oriented programming language that continues to build momentum. It can do everything Java, C/C++/C#, Ruby, PHP, and Perl can do, but it's also fun & intuitive! Enjoy coding as fast as you think with a simple yet robust syntax that encourages group collaboration. It is known for several popular web frameworks, including Django (Python's equivalent to Ruby on Rails), Pyramid, and web2py. There is also Google App Engine, where Python was the first supported runtime. Users supporting Zope, Plone, Trac, and Mailman will also benefit from knowing some Python. Python can do XML/ReST/XSLT, multithreading, SQL/databases, GUIs, hardcore math/science, Internet client/server systems & networking (heard of Twisted?), GIS/ESRI, QA/test, automation frameworks, plus system administration tasks too! On the education front, it's a great tool to teach programming with (especially those who have done Scratch or Tynker already) as well as a solid (first) language to learn for non-programmers and other technical staff. Finally, if Python doesn't do what you want, you can extend it in C/C++, Java, or C# (even VB.NET)! Have you noticed the huge growth in the number of jobs on Monster & Dice that list Python as a desired skill? Come find out why Google, Yahoo!, Disney, Cisco, YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, LucasFilm/ILM, Pixar, NASA, Ubuntu, Bank of America, and Red Hat all use Python!",

Combining Machine Learning with cloud technologies, such as Azure, reduces the friction and lowers the knowledge barriers for people doing their own experimentation on data. Azure ML, a new offering from Microsoft, allows us to harness the power or Machine Learning and Big Data with little more than a browser and a credit card. In this session, we will take a look at how to create ML models with Azure ML Studio and deploy those models to production in minutes. We will also touch on integrating Azure ML with HDInsight (Hadoop as a Service on Azure). Participants will walk away with basic knowledge necessary to start applying a bit of ML magic to their own data sets, no matter how big or small.",

But once you get to know them, you’ll see that they are a great addition to your toolbox. Used properly, they can add elegance and simplicity to your code. And some .NET constructs (such as LINQ) lend themselves to lambda expressions. We’ll take a look at how lambda expressions work and see them in action.  No specific experience is required (but some .NET is helpful).",

A recording comes from the device, is processed on a remote server, which sends some text back to the user. Round-trip latency: <200ms. Can we ever achieve better results with a microprocessor running FOSS or is speech truly a black box problem? State of the art ASR libraries are certainly slower and less accurate, suggesting all of the innovation will happen inside a datacenter or microchip, behind NDAs and closed doors. We will review the state of offline ASR technology and attempt to deconstruct that notion. No prior speech recognition experience is required.",

In this session we will take that application and make (a few) modifications (mostly to config) to get it running on the same components in the cloud, specifically on the Cloud Foundry PaaS.  We’ll show you how to use the Spring Cloud project to configure the deployment, how to leverage a cloud services catalog, how to implement a cross-site scripting solution (and why), how to do session state caching and we’ll discuss (the dangers of) auto reconfiguration. If you bring a laptop you can have your own instance of the app running by end of session.",

Cloud Foundry, the leading (open source) Platform as a Service (PaaS), is designed to remove friction from the traditional application lifecycle, from dev all the way through production. At the core it exposes application and services “dial tone”, rather than infrastructure “dial tone”, scoping a broad set of capabilities such as autoscaling, dynamic routing, logging, monitoring, health management, and more, around the application. Light on slides and heavy on demo, in this session we’ll share what motivates the direction of the project, and show you how easy it is to write applications for and deploy them into this cloud runtime.",

Now databases come with new data models, new index schemes, and new scaling architectures.  They're also much more cloud-focused than previous systems.\n\nIt's an exciting time again to be a database administrator, or a programmer, and this talk gets you oriented.  We'll cover how we got here, where we're at, and where we're going.  We'll discuss data models (key-value, document, graph), licensing (open source, commercial), and transaction models (ACID vs BASE).  We'll also show running code.\n",

To start, we will purchase and put together the raw hardware. But software rules the world, and that’s where a bulk of the presentation will focus. The code will need to be able to take a picture and upload it to the cloud. From there, a push notification will need to be sent to the appropriate mobile device(s), indicating that someone has pressed the doorbell, and that the photo is available.\n\nWhat other capabilities with respect to CPU, memory, and storage?\nWhat expansion boards are available and what purpose do they serve?\nWhat type of programming tools are available?\nWhat programming languages are supported in the device itself?\nWhat role does the cloud play with respect to security?\nWhich networking connectivity solutions that should be considered for device-to-cloud communication?\nHow does the cloud help alleviate bandwidth challenges and minimize power consumption on the device?\nWhat are the four patterns for device to cloud service message communication?\n",

Well then this is the session for you.  In this session, we will first attempt to define what is Big Data.  From there, we will explore not only the need for big data but also promise big data has for the technology world.  We will finish by talking about the technology used to harness this data.  We will talk about some of the parallel technology like Cassandra, MongoDB and Big Table but will focus deeper on Hadoop and its companion technologies like Hive and Pig.   There will be some demos but this talk will serve as the introduction to the more in depth talks I will be doing on Hadoop. ",

However, with great power also comes great power to do things incorrectly, which leads to many projects based on XAML technologies that are in trouble in some way. In this session Markus will take a look at XAML Anti-Patterns – common solutions that end up being ineffective and counterproductive. Among the discussed patterns and techniques are things like bootstrappers, virtualization, resources, XAML itself, and much, much more. Many of the presented topics may surprise even advanced XAML developers.\n\n",

Stop wondering if it’s your code or the network, I’ll show you how to point the finger at the right culprit.\n\nWe will follow the life of an HTTP packet as it goes from your web browser to the server and back. Learn how to determine what stopped the mission of that packet and why. Was it name resolution? TCP Port availability issues? Do we need to sniff the packets to find the problem? This session will make you a better programmer regardless of the technology you are using.",

This is an important enabler for systems that use auto scaling patterns. We have built an abstraction interface on top of several cache providers we evaluated. This gives us a common model for analyzing performance data, like TPS. We open sourced some of this work into a library called CacheSharp (on Github and NuGet). In this session we’ll show you how we run tests against several providers, establish a baseline of data, and compare the results. This is something you should be able to take back to your dev shop and get started with in an afternoon.",

This has always been a painful point for any big data application developer. \nSpringXD (http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/) tries to simplify these challenges by unifying all the big data use cases into a single product and thererby makes it easy to solve common big data problems such as data ingestion and export, real-time analytics, and batch workflow orchestration.\nIn this session, we will discuss the capabilities of Spring XD and I will show how to build a real world big data application using Spring XD.\n",

It contains robust implementations\nof WebSocket, Batch, JSON, Concurrency, JMS2, JAX-RS 2, CDI 1.1, and\nall Java EE 7 technologies. Undertow is the new cutting-edge web\nserver in WildFly 8 and is designed for maximum throughput and\nscalability, including environments with over a million connections.\nThe number of ports is reduced by multiplexing protocols over HTTP\nusing HTTP Upgrade.\n\nRole Based Access Control support organizations with separated\nmanagement responsibilities and restrictions. Roles represent\ndifferent sets of permissions such as runtime operation execution,\nconfiguration areas that can read or written, and the ability to audit\nchanges and manage users. In addition a new restricted audit log can\nbe enabled including the ability to offload to a secure syslog server.\nIt also provides a rich web-based administration console and a\npowerful CLI for management. Multi instance cluster with high\navailability can be easily created.\n\nYou don't even need to download WildFly in order to experience this\nfunctionality. Applications can be directly deployed to OpenShift, Red\nHat's open source PaaS offering.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of all these features using\nseveral live demos.",

JAX-RS 2 adds a new Client API to invoke the RESTful endpoints, allows asynchronous client/server, and server-side content negotiation. JMS 2 is undergoing a complete overhaul to align with improvements in the Java language. Long awaited Batch Processing API and Concurrency are now added to build applications using capabilities of the platform itself. Together these APIs allow you to be more productive by simplifying enterprise development.\nWebSocket attempts to solve the issues and limitations of HTTP for real-time communication. A new API is added to build WebSocket driven applications. Processing JSON structures is inherent in any HTML5 applications and a new API to parse and generate JSON is being added to the platform. JavaServer Faces will add support for creating reusable flows and HTML5-friendly markup. There are several other improvements in this latest version of the platform.\nThe Java EE 7 platform was released last year. This talk will explain how to do Java EE 7 development using Eclipse. Don't miss out on this session to learn all about how to leverage the new and exciting standards in building your next enterprise application.",

Stop configuring and tweaking file watchers, minifiers, and transpilers just to get to a runnable app. Instead, go from zero to \"hello world\" in 30 seconds. In the next 30 seconds, easily add capabilities and frameworks to your application simply by installing *Rave Extensions* and *Rave Starter* packages from npm and Bower, the leading JavaScript package managers. Finally, install additional *Rave Extension* packages to apply your favorite build, deploy, and testing patterns.\n",

                            "description": "Designing a really clean and intuitive REST + JSON API is no small feat.  You have to worry about resources, collections of resources, pagination, query parameters, references to other resources, which HTTP Methods to use, HTTP Caching, security, and more!  And you have to make sure it lasts and doesn't break clients as you add features over time. Further, while there are many references on creating REST APIs with XML, there are much fewer references for REST + JSON.\n\nIn this presentation, Les Hazlewood - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API.  He will cover:\n\n* JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API\n* References to other JSON-based resources (aka 'linking').\n* Resource collections and pagination\n* How to map (and how not to map) HTTP methods to Resource CRUD\n* Resource partial updates\n* Supporting HTTP Method Overloading for clients that don't support HTTP PUT and DELETE\n* API versioning strategies\n* Meaningful Error responses\n* Many-to-many resource relationships\n* HTTP Caching and Optimistic concurrency control.\n* Authentication and Security\n",

However, to get beyond hello world takes some doing, even if it is easier than ever.  This code walkthrough will go over basics such as Security (Log in), User provisioning (Sign Up), JSON APIs, error handling, application events, HTML5 SPA bootstrapping, instrumentation, service and repository layers, Apache HTTP and Tomcat configuration as well as Cloud deployment processing and packaging.",

I’ll walk you through the steps needed to create an API that developers love, and point out the common traps to avoid.\n\nThe presentation will cover creating user stories, deciding on metrics, planning the API, design decisions, documentation and developer support. I will focus on teaching you how to create a developer experience that will delight and amaze your developer partners and increase engagement with your platform. This talk will focus on higher level choices rather than HTTP architecture, and is appropriate for developers, product managers, or anyone else with an interest in achieving success for their API program.\n\nThe Open API Ecosystem is an amazing opportunity for companies to partner with developers, but you really only get one chance to impress, so come learn how to make your company’s API an “A List” destination.",

Tenaya is a Rogue Maker and since March 16th 2013, has been learning all about Arduino, Linino, and Lilypad Arduino.  Tenaya holds a B.A. degree in Theatre & Drama, Geological Sciences, and Anthropology.  Her Grandpa was a Tau Beta Pi Engineer and Eta Kappa Nu Electrical Engineer...so it's only natural that Tenaya earned Phi Beta Kappa in 2005 (of course with much hard work!) She is mostly self taught in microcontroller coding and electrical engineering.  Diane and Esther, Tenaya's mom and grandma, taught her how to sew and now those skills are really paying off to use conductive thread to sew LEDs into garments.  Join us for a fun workshop to introduce you to sewing LEDs into your own clothing.  We'll also provide fabric to inspire you and to practice the parallel circuits.  Tenaya teaches a 3 part workshop where we 1) Design 2) Prototype, and 3) Make (sew!) Choose from 6 colors of LEDs with Tenaya's #RogueMaking Lilypad kits. More sensors and LEDs are available through the workshop as well. Rogue Making wearable tech kits will be an additional $20-$35 for take-home materials to keep. Prototyping materials, fabric, and sewing supplies provided.",

We will explore the differences between managing and leading, review different management styles, and discuss their impact on both the manager and the team member. Finally, we will find out why you do not want to treat everyone equally.\n\nI will share my personal experiences going from being one of the team to actually managing it: the pitfalls of suddenly being responsible for the team, typical problems surfacing, and how to avoid common mistakes. As part of the session, I would also like to share thoughts and considerations about which career path could be the right one for whom, and what the advantages and disadvantages are going one way or the other.\nThis is not a “You get it all from the expert”- session, but a session to share experiences and discuss how this fits to your career path.",

This first session creates the foundation for the 2nd Clean Code presentation on Dependency Injection, as it explains expected base knowledge. \n\nWhy writing Clean Code makes us more efficient Over the lifetime of a product, maintaining the product is actually one - if not the most - expensive area(s) of the overall product costs. The Craftsmanship session is exploring the often underestimated importance of clean execution of the coding part and its crucial impact to overall project success. Writing clean code can significantly lower these costs. \n\nHowever, writing clean code also makes you more efficient during the initial development time and results in more stable code. You will be presented design patterns and best practices which will make you write better and more easily maintainable code, seeing code in a holistic way. \n\nYou will learn how to apply them by using an existing implementation as the starting point of the presentation. Finally, practices benefits are explained. \n\nThis presentation is based on C# and Visual Studio 2013. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.",

Whether an open source, cross-platform, .NET, iOS, Android or Linux developer (or all of the above), this panel will let you tap into the real-world experiences of Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs). You will also learn about what it takes to receive and benefit from the MVP Award, and how to get started with the MVP Mentor program. Raucous (or at least mildly amusing) stories guaranteed.",

In this age of Lean Startup and the philosophy that, in a startup the CEO is the Product Manager, most detailed product decisions end up being made by developers.  But, are these the right people to be making those choices.  As is often the case in tech and in life, the answer is a resounding \"It Depends!\"\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore a number of real-life situations that show the good, the bad, and the ugly of working with and without Product Managers.",

We will then examine the two models of the Rubik's cube: first using object oriented programming and then using functional programming just to get a feel of these two techniques. We will also discuss some algorithms to find useful moves by simple search mechanism enhanced with Rubik's cube common sense. Join us if you are new to JavaScript, have interest in Rubik's cube or just want to have some fun with programming.\nFor those who attended this session last year, you will like the new features in Java Script and an introduction to Functional Programming.  I promise we will have some fun time with the Rubik’s cube too.\n",

This session provides JavaScript developers with a quick start to building Web applications with AngularJS.\n \nThe session begins with a gentle, acronym-free overview of Angular, its purpose and benefits. Then using only a simple text editor, such as Notepad, and a browser, the developer will learn how to incorporate basic Angular features such as directives, expressions, filters, and data binding into a basic Web page.\n \nThe second half of the session introduces WebStorm as a development tool and expands the Web page into a Single Page Application (SPA). In small and deliberate steps, the developer will learn how to create a controller, two user interface views, and the routing required to switch between the two views.",

Greg will give a talk on Undo’s record and replay debugging technology that allows Linux software developers to record their C/C++ program's execution, and then \"wind the tape\" back and forth in real-time. This gives a clear view of a program's execution, allowing the root causes of bugs to be found with astonishing ease. Much of the guesswork and trial-and-error is removed, meaning that bugs that might otherwise have taken weeks to fix can now be fixed in minutes. UndoDB uses advanced optimization techniques to allow practical debugging of even very large and CPU-intensive programs, with typical slow-down of only 2-4x (compared to 50,000x for gdb's process record).\n \nThrough a series of demos Greg will give an in-depth look at the Undo technology and how it works. Greg will also detail how to record a program's execution and debug problems on-site at the customer. There will be time for an interactive Q and A session at the end of the talk.\n",

Writing an application that lazily loads large amounts of data from the server, includes drag-and-drop and compelling visualizations does not require one to write any HTML or  JavaScript.\n\nThe framework is based on a server centric development model that provides the best productivity, but it also supports client-side development with the built-in GWT Java to JavaScript compiler. It also allows you to go through the abstractions and write JavaScript directly. The looks of the application is customized with SASS language using powerful Valo theme. The end result can be run in any HTML5 capable browser and deployed to any Java based server or cloud.\n\nThe presentation gives an overview to Vaadin and explains how it works. We'll show how to use the parameterized Valo themes and powerful new Grid component. The session should give you everything you need to get started building your own apps with the free Apache-licensed Vaadin.",

                            "description": "<p>A common misconception about agile is that managers are unnecessary. After all, agile is based on self-organizing teams. If the teams organize themselves, what do managers do? </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, most scrum training plays into that. Think about it: how many trainers or coaches have you seen sketch the structure of a scrum team with a drawing that includes a manager? While there's always a scrum master and a product owner, the core team and maybe some stakeholders, have you ever seen a manager in that drawing?&#160; </p>\n\n<p>This misconception can be a problem all around: A frequently cited barrier to agile adoption is managers who don't know what to do when their teams become self-managing. When they're not included in training, how would they (or anyone else, for that matter) know how to characterize their role. At the same time, organizations often lay down expectations of managers, some compatible with agile, some not.&#160; </p>\n\n<p>Agile has clearly shifted the old roles and responsibilities. Managers bent on command-and-control are clearly a barrier to agile adoption. But managers who take a hands-off approach or are treading water in a sea of ambiguity will almost certainly stymie adoption, as well. </p>\n\n<p>Ron Lichty believes (and so do a lot of the early agile thought leaders) that managers have critical roles to play in enabling success, both of transitions to agile and of agile itself. This session is about those roles.</p>",

Agile thrives with individual teams, yet even Ken Schwaber asserts 75% of organizations using scrum won't succeed in getting the benefits they hope for from it. Many such organizations have been structured by default along hierarchical lines, rather than by design for iterative work. A set of established and emerging ideas to address organizational impediments point to a future where Agile introductions Go Big, rather than Go Home. Not simply theory, this session will overlay these ideas onto a real world example of a hw/sw business that scaled from break even to $1B+ in 4y. Come learn which Sticky Bits to Flip to successfully run Agile at Enterprise Scale.",

That means you're syncing, and syncing is hard. This talk will cover all the things you're probably NOT thinking about when rolling your own syncing engine, like offline caching, change notification, and advanced conflict resolution. Drawing from his experience at Dropbox and Microsoft, Steve will discuss the thorny challenges and potential solutions for sync.",

Visual Studio 2013 streamlines the way developers build modern business applications for Office 365 and SharePoint 2013 with the Office 365 Cloud Business App project. In this demo-heavy session, you will see the latest enhancements we’ve made that allow developers to build connected, touch-centric, cross-platform, HTML5-based business applications for Office 365.",

These new devices interface directly with mobile devices via a Bluetooth connection and are designed to provide input all day long.\n \nWhat potential does the Brain-Computer Interface provide for wearable purposes? What is the difference between passive monitoring and active detection? What sort of input is possible? Is the Brain-Computer Interface one way, or is direct brain input possible too?\n \nIn this class, we will dive into the future of thought as input for wearable development with real-world examples and code. Demonstrations will be shown using the Emotiv EPOC headset, a high resolution, neuro-signal acquisition and processing wireless neuroheadset that uses a set of sensors to tune into electric signals produced by the brain to detect thoughts, feelings and expressions. Additional devices will be discussed and may be used as they become available.\n \nYou will see the EEG neuroheadset and brain-computer interface with examples of interfacing with desktop and mobile apps. We will dive into the roots of the technology, showing code and examples along with big pictures of the technology. You will walk away with an understanding of how this still evolving and largely unknown technology really works, how it can be used, as well as longer-term implications.",

Video games are extremely popular on smart phones and tablets. While the odds are against your game becoming a smash hit, is still possible to make a fun game which generates a bit of money via direct sales or in-game advertising. \n\nIn this three part session we will explore using Cocos2d-x, an open source game engine, to build games for all three major smart phone platforms - Android, Apple, and Microsoft. Unlike other game engines, Cocos2d-x is not only free, it runs on multiple platforms giving you the ability to port your game not only to the most popular phone platforms but to desktop platforms like Windows and Mac OS X.\n",

The course also features an in-depth live demonstration of the architecture and principles at work.\nWe begin with trying to establish a clear functional definition of row-level security, and an examination of real-world contexts which either demand or benefit from such a model.  \nWe then discuss the various kinds of requirements that can impact level of complexity of a particular solution.  This leads us into developing a database model that supports the standard superset of likely use-cases.  We’ll start with the simplest possible implementation and then discuss the addition of layers of complexity such as the classic “Top Secret / Confidential / Classified / UnClassified” hierarchies, and other approaches to access.\nFinally, we’ll connect to a live Microsoft SQL Server database with many of these principles implemented, and conduct several tests and demonstrations which illustrate how to implement the principles.\n",

This session will take an in-depth look at some of the key challenges facing entrepreneurs whose products and services are starting to sell, and who are experiencing rapidly-expanding growth.  The goal of the session is to leaving you asking the right questions of the right people so you can set up appropriate, scalable business processes BEFORE your well-deserved growth turns into months-on-end of business-process fire-fighting and sleepless nights, especially for your CFO and CEO.  You’d rather get back to innovating, so why not set yourself up for graceful growth from the beginning?\nWe’ll examine common systems growing companies need such as quote-to-cash pipeline, revenue recognition and revenue forecasting, to name a few.  We’ll discuss the usual causes of problem faced by these systems, and take a look at additional problems associated with those same causes.  Then we’ll discuss data and system planning and architecture methodologies that can help you grapple with these challenges, ideally before they even occur, so that your path to success can be smoother, swifter and much more profitable.\nAlong the way we’ll discuss requirements-gathering, product- and customer-to-business-process matrices, data integration concerns, and actual business process and workflow design.\n",

Uses of the overlay layers provided by WPF, Silverlight and Javascrip map controls to add you own annotation and display features to a map display.\n\n2. Use of the Jason and XML interface provide by the Web base Bing and Google map servers to request the creation of custom map displays\n\n3. The title based map element architecture used by the Web to store map data elements and how used web requests to acquire the title elements and assemble you own custom map displays. This approach is more complex that the first two; however it give the developer complex control over the map's appearance and format\n\n4. The fourth topic concerns the relationship between the WCS-84 geographic coordinates system used by the Google and Bing map services and the state plan coordinates system commonly used by government, utilities and other for survey data, The presentation will include a discussion of available resources of converting location define in state plan coordinates into a location in WCS-84 coordinates\n",

GameMaker Studio is also advanced enough for seasoned game developers to build games for desktops, web (HTML5),  and Android & iOS mobile devices.\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, you will be introduced to GameMaker Studio drag and drop functionality to build an arcade game, with brief exposure to scripting.  In the process, you will learn how to create a \"game plan\", identifying the game assets and objects, and designing behaviors and interactions.  I will also mention the advantages of GameMaker over other game development environments such as Stencyl,  GameSalad, Construct 2, and Unity.\n\nIf you'd like to do the exercise, please  bring a Windows laptop or a Mac with Windows on a Virtual Machine or Bootcamp. Also, if possible, download and install the free GameMaker Studio Standard ahead of time (http://www.yoyogames.com/studio/download)",

Seasoned in Colorado, his career launched with Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 – he was delivering data-centric solutions while “database developer” was a novel term. He received a civilian Naval Commendation for security work, preceding his work for the Start Up that become Microsoft CRM. The bulk of Jerry's work targeted insurance and finance, especially not-for-profits. For 15 years, he built Microsoft-centric solutions and mobile apps. Today, Jerry speaks on XAML, mobility and Kinect at events, communities, and schools – influencing another generation of excellent, Microsoft developers. To that end, most of Jerry’s free time is spent teaching his three daughters Star Trek character backstories and episode plots.",

                            "description": "<p>APIs have become a part of the product ecosystem - and help the businesses by extending their developer base, and offering seamless integration with other services or products. Sometimes, the APIs themselves are the product. However, with so many APIs around, patterns emerge. Patterns are repeatable, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems. Where there are <i>patterns</i>, there are also <i>antipatterns</i>. </p>\n\n<p>While APIs are not a new paradigm - there are no set standards or specifications formed by a committees or governing bodies for APIs. On top of this, the APIs are often built at various stages of the product, and have a good chance of being disjoint as more are added. In this talk I’ll discuss various antipatterns that creep into the API design and implementation, and how to identify and avoid them. I will also share my experience with building APIs at Netflix as a reference. </p>\n\n<p>While the antipatterns do not pose as big a functional challenge, they can and do impact integration efforts, scalability and performance among other things. After my session, you should be able to get familiar with the best practices around solving the most common patterns, and make your engineers and API consumers happy!</p>",

First we will explore the fashion industry, as a system for producing and distributing clothing and accessories.  Then the speaker will cover aspects of modernization & globalization including eco-innovation, crowdsourcing and pre-tailing. This section will end by offering “insider hints” highlighting how to collaborate with a fashion company.\n\nSecond we will cover advanced technologies used to build wearable fashion with an overview of MEMS (motion, position, environmental and capture) sensors and wireless (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0) connectivity used to build wearable fashion with code samples (iOS & Android) capturing physiological data. We will review of the current wearable market (eg. Nike Fuelband, Shine, Lark, Fitbit, Bodybug & Google - Glass / Moto / Ara).  This section will provide a real world example of placing Bluetooth 4.0 connected MEMS devices into a shoe which will lead to some surprising capabilities (telling us how to exercise properly).  This section will conclude by exploring this final thought.   “If it looks amazing and does not work well people will forgive but if it works great and it is ugly, no one will wear it.”\n\nThe talk will culminate by showing how these two industries will co-evolve and the different forms these collaborations can take. Their growth will now come from radically new products that combine the best that these two industries can offer. \n",

That use of JSON makes for some very interesting integration pieces with MongoDB. In this talk I will start by introducing some of the basic concepts of Vert.x, such as Verticles, EventBus, and a ton of built in features. From there I will demonstrate how easy it is to run a WebSocket enabled application that provides live tracking map of airplane flights. The code will be a mix of JavaScript, Java, and Python to flex some polyglotness. Then with a few lines of code I will demonstrate how easy it is to push the same feed of data straight into a spatially enabled MongoDB instance. Given the way both plaforms are such a close fit, I will show how easy it is to also add a REST query service right on top of the API. Don't let all the Node.JS hipsters have all the fun - come see the exciting possibilities for JavaScript or Java application with Vert.x and MongoDB. ",

Everything from enterprise databases to the thermostat in your house can communicate via HTTP-based web services.  But how well do you really know this critical part of the internet?  Are you equipped with the knowledge needed to build apps and services that can participate? This talk is a technology agnostic deep dive into the guts of HTTP.  You will leave with a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol, and how combed with the REST architectural pattern, HTTP lets you build amazingly simple and scalable web services regardless of the technology stack you’re using.

I'll show you through concrete examples ways you can apply the constraints of the REST architectural style to Web API to create truly RESTful web services.

                            "description": "AngularJS has changed the way we think about web-development. This session is for programmers interested in using AngularJS seriously and will focus on three patterns of usage: multi-page, single page, and legacy applications. Multi-page applications follow a straight-forward MVC paradigm. Single-page applications with lots of interactions are much more complex, and require the use of nested directives. Legacy applications are those where you can only use Angular in some portions of an existing web application. This requires thoughtful data passing to make your Angular widgets work. In addition, keeping domain logic modular is a challenge, and we will show how we use Typescript to do this. We will also show examples of code before and after Angularizing them, in particular, comparing it to Backbone. If you have never seen AngularJS in action, we recommend taking one of the beginner AngularJS sessions at CodeCamp before you come to this session. If you are starting out with Angular, this session will leave you with a useful map of patterns of wisdom that will help you ask the right questions as you are designing your solution.\n\nPlease download the slides in the Materials link and bring it with you to the session so you can follow along (there's code in it).",

                            "description": "Come with your laptops to learn and try out test-driven development for web applications using TypeScript, Jasmine and AngularJS. TypeScript provides a great way to bring the advantages of compiled languages over to the world of Javascript. We will demonstrate test-driven development by writing a simple application to unscramble Anagrams using TypeScript. Tests will be written before we write actual business logic. Then, we will wire it up with AngularJS to get some web pizzazz. We will also show how we can extend our unit testing to test AngularJS controllers. We will end with an icing of Bootstrap and you will return with a great setup for Agile Web Development.\n\nYou can attend this session as a viewer but you can also dive in and follow along.

An engaged employee is loyal, energetic, and enthusiastic about his/her job and the company. As a technology training and engagement group at PayPal we have devised programs that support technologists to grow by following the principles of autonomy, mastery and purpose. Autonomy makes technologists self sufficient, mastery arms them with skills to be the best in their trade and purpose provides them with a reason to grow, learn and excel. This growth is measured by Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS). eNPS helps understand which elements of employee engagement advocate employee loyalty and which areas require improvement.

Then you need to learn about managed data services in Bluemix.  We will show how IBM Bluemix, an open-standards, cloud-based developer platform for building, deploying and managing apps can be leveraged for rapid application development on the cloud built on top of enterprise-level data services.  We will discuss and demo two such Bluemix services, SQL Database and Analytics Warehouse.  SQL Database adds an on-demand relational database to your Bluemix hosted application.  Powered by DB2, it provides a managed database service to handle demanding web and transactional workloads.  Analytics Warehouse service can be used for predictive analytics which can be applied to many areas including business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) areas, such as customer acquisition, retention, and winback. These analytics can be applied to technical tasks, such as predictive maintenance.  We will discuss how can we leverage analytics service in the cloud to provide the statistical analysis capability of R by using sample data sets that are stored in the BLU Acceleration for Cloud database.  Join us to get hands on and learn how to use SQLDB, AWH, and In-database R capability in the cloud. You will also learn to pump-in NOSQL document datasets into the warehouse for predictive analytics.",

For example, in HBase you cannot do transactions spanning multiple tables.  In this session, you will learn how, in some cases, to work around to implement transactions using HBase. We will explore real-world big data problems and talk about architectures, APIs, and key parts of HBase for developing efficient big data applications to solve these problems. In this session, you will learn how setup MapR Sandbox and get started with HBase application development. We will go through some best practices and how to apply them using demos and code.\nI can present this as a 50 minutes session or 120 minutes Hands-on Lab/Session.",

This approach avoids many of the problems of a monolithic architecture. It simplifies deployment and let’s you create highly scalable and available applications.\n\nIn this talk we describe the micro-service architecture and how to use it to build complex applications. You will learn how techniques such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing address the key challenges of developing applications with this architecture. We will also cover some of the various frameworks such as NodeJS and Spring Boot that you can use to implement micro-services.\n",

We will describe how you use them to process collections in Java and Scala. You will learn how functional Futures and Rx (Reactive Extensions) Observables simplify concurrent code.

The objective of the session is to help you install the fundamental building blocks of a world-class sales engine at your company. \n\nTo emerge from the early stages of building a new business, startups need to stay focused on two things: building and selling. The first is by far the most important. You can't sell what you don't ship, and if it's not built specifically with the customer's needs in mind, it'll be next to impossible to sell even with a great sales system.\n\nIn this presentation, you'll learn about common sales mistakes made by startups, how to build a buyer-centric sales process that scales, best practices for how to shorten your sales cycles and more.\n\nBENEFITS\n-Build sustainable, mutually beneficial relationships with prospects and customers\n-Uncover sales opportunities and close deals sooner\n-Establish trust by showing you’re focused on your customer’s needs\n-Develop solution-oriented value propositions\n-Learn to handle objections and move toward a close\n-Distinguish yourself from pitch-based sales\n\nCURRICULUM\n-Getting the meeting\n-Opening and sustaining dialogue\n-Listening and probing for needs\n-Uncovering key motivators\n-Eliciting commitments that lead to an identifiable close\n-Scheduling next steps",

This talk will take an intimate look at two of today’s most popular frameworks, Angular and Backbone and explore their differences.  We’ll show how Apache Cordova opens the world of mobile app development to web developers. In the session, we will demonstrate a “To Do” app using Angular and Backbone, with access to native device capabilities.

I'm specifically focusing on advice that will help us write better code. I've written a lot of horrible code in my career, and learned a lot of lessons in the process. In my day job I also get the opportunity to look at a lot of other teams code, and help them clean it up. Over my career I've gotten a pretty good idea of what I believe are the most important lessons when learning to write \"good\" code. And here's a hint, it's not neatly captured in the SOLID set of principles that seem to be so popular at conferences these days.  Expect a lot of examples and concrete advice that you can take away and start applying immediately to improve your code.",

The mqnic interface provides a completely virtualized, high performance ethernet abstraction without requiring external IP infrastructure to support VM IP network routing and termination.\n<br/>\nBased on the ivshmem technology originally developed by Cam Macdonell\nthe mqnic drivers use zero copy vm<->host data transfers and the apache\nmessage bus to provide low latency, high bandwidth IP support for\nvirtual data centers while simplifying the provisioning of hosted IP.\n<br/>\nThe link layer transport virtualization is provided by the ActiveMQ message bus managed under the control of a host side server and is completely transparent to the data center IP infrastructure. This completely eliminates the need for specialized IT routing and termination infrastructure to support mqnic virtualized networks.\n<br/>\nWithin the virtualized domains the mqnic virtualization is completely transparent. The mqnic driver appears as a standard ethernet device and is configured and managed using standard IP Linux services for termination and routing.",

                            "description": "In this presentation (and a live demonstration) you will see why Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a powerful technology for asynchronous stream processing. RTI Data Distribution Service (DDS) will be used as the source of data and as a communication channel for asynchronous data streams. On top of DDS, we'll use Rx to subscribe, observe, project, filter, aggregate, merge, zip, and correlate one or more data streams (Observables). The live demo will be very visual as bouncing shapes of different colors will be transformed in front of you using C# lambdas, Rx.NET, and LinqPad. You will also learn about the new Rx4DDS.NET library that integrates RTI DDS with Rx.NET. Rx and DDS are a great match because both are reactive. Rx is based on the subject-observer pattern, which is quite analogous to the publish-subscribe pattern of DDS. When used together they support distributed dataflows seamlessly. If time permits, we will touch upon advanced Rx concepts such as stream of streams (IGroupedObservable) and how it captures DDS \"keyed topics\". The DDS applications using Rx4DDS.NET dramatically simplify concurrency to the extent that it can be simply configured. Sounds too good to be true? Listen to the talk and watch the demo.",

Just like virtual functions open doors to the OO paradigm, lambdas open doors to a different paradigm--the Functional paradigm. This talk is not a praise of functional programming or some elusive lambda-based library. (Although, I'll mention one briefly that tops my list these days) Instead, the goal is to have fun while working our way through some mind-bending examples of C++14 lambdas. Beware, your brain will hurt! Bring your laptop and code the examples right along because that may be the fastest way to answer the quiz.",

To start, we will purchase and put together the raw hardware. But software rules the world, and that’s where a bulk of the presentation will focus. The code will need to be able to take a picture and upload it to the cloud. From there, a push notification will need to be sent to the appropriate mobile device(s), indicating that someone has pressed the doorbell, and that the photo is available.\n\nWhat other capabilities with respect to CPU, memory, and storage?\nWhat expansion boards are available and what purpose do they serve?\nWhat type of programming tools are available?\nWhat programming languages are supported in the device itself?\nWhat role does the cloud play with respect to security?\nWhich networking connectivity solutions that should be considered for device-to-cloud communication?\nHow does the cloud help alleviate bandwidth challenges and minimize power consumption on the device?\nWhat are the four patterns for device to cloud service message communication?\n",

Functional Programming has been around for a while, but it is gaining popularity, especially due to direct support in languages on the JVM and the CLR. Writing code in functional style is not about syntax, it is a paradigm shift.\n\nIn this presentation, using examples in F# and C#, you will learn how to write code in functional style. We will start out discussing the elements of functional programming and then look at examples of some common operations and how you can implement those in functional style.",

Too often, the tools we are provided with only show a small part of the picture, leaving us to guess what else might be happening behind the scenes. Glimpse is an open source project that aims to change the way we think about diagnostics and the frameworks we interact with. \n\nAfter releasing Glimpse at Mix 11, Glimpse has become a tool that is used daily by tens of thousands of developers around the world. In this session, youíll learn how to use Glimpse to reveal a complete picture of what is happening within your ASP.NET MVC and WebForms sites, discover what tools are included out of the box, and see how you can easily extend it to suit your needs.",

Discussion will include sketching general concepts, user flows, user interface elements, basic wireframes, and problem statements. There will also be an opportunity to practice with several hands on activities.

So with Cloud Computing how do we keep up with the growing demand for maintenance tasks for these \"infinitely scalable\" assets?  The answer is automation.  \n\nAzure Automation is a highly available automation service which helps you \"Automate all the things\".  Anything from deployments, to monitoring to maintenance tasks can be set up using this reliable workflow execution engine.  This presentation covers the fundamentals of the Azure Automation service and provides some insights into how to leverage it with your own solutions.\n",

                            "description": "AngularJS has changed the way we think about web-development. This session is for programmers interested in using AngularJS seriously and will focus on three patterns of usage: multi-page, single page, and legacy applications. Multi-page applications follow a straight-forward MVC paradigm. Single-page applications with lots of interactions are much more complex, and require the use of nested directives. Legacy applications are those where you can only use Angular in some portions of an existing web application. This requires thoughtful data passing to make your Angular widgets work. In addition, keeping domain logic modular is a challenge, and we will show how we use Typescript to do this. We will also show examples of code before and after Angularizing them, in particular, comparing it to Backbone. If you have never seen AngularJS in action, we recommend taking one of the beginner AngularJS sessions at CodeCamp before you come to this session. If you are starting out with Angular, this session will leave you with a useful map of patterns of wisdom that will help you ask the right questions as you are designing your solution.\n\nPlease download the slides in the Materials link and bring it with you to the session so you can follow along (there's code in it).",

                            "description": "Come with your laptops to learn and try out test-driven development for web applications using TypeScript, Jasmine and AngularJS. TypeScript provides a great way to bring the advantages of compiled languages over to the world of Javascript. We will demonstrate test-driven development by writing a simple application to unscramble Anagrams using TypeScript. Tests will be written before we write actual business logic. Then, we will wire it up with AngularJS to get some web pizzazz. We will also show how we can extend our unit testing to test AngularJS controllers. We will end with an icing of Bootstrap and you will return with a great setup for Agile Web Development.\n\nYou can attend this session as a viewer but you can also dive in and follow along.

It would be very useful to be able to express the same sequential representation in a unit test, with the operations in different threads defined in the same flow.\n\nI present a framework for doing this. It ships lambda expressions to any number of locally initialized threads, synchronizing, or optionally randomizing, the start times of each thread's block of code, and providing mechanisms to check in an assertion (for example) whether two or more threads are deadlocked or livelocked, whether a point of execution was reached while it was expected to be protected, and other such violations of concurrency expectations. Mechanisms are also provided for looping and timing.",

Instead of the traditional approach of the applications conforming to the OS, now the OS can be determined by the applications. OS synthesis can also rearrange and optimize existing code to meet specific timing constraints on a particular hardware platform. The resulting application specific operating system (ASOS) has strengthened security, increased reliability, lower hardware costs, reduced debug time, and minimized memory footprint, all of which are critical to devices connected to the Internet of Things.",

Hopefully, we'll have an intellectually-stimulating discussion where everybody will learn something new and get a fresh perspective on how to make the most of their potential. ",
