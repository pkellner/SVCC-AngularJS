        "description": "This presentation will talk about ZURB's recent addition to the Foundation family: Foundation for Apps. Foundation for Apps harnesses the power of AngularJS to create easy-to-use components for AngularJS developers, but also users that might not have in-depth knowledge of AngularJS or JavaScript. In addition to a brief summary of Foundation for Apps, we'll take a look at how we've integrated AngularJS into the framework, examples of some of the custom directives built for Foundation for Apps, and some of the lessons learned throughout the process.

You likely need to talk to secured services, you need to lock down parts of your app and you need to maintain good application structure to name a few things. In this workshop we’ll build an enterprise Angular app from start to finish in TypeScript and secure sections of the app using Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. Well see how we can access a user’s mailbox to use their email, contacts and calendar that resides in Office 365. We’ll store files within the user’s OneDrive files. You’ll see how to store collaborative data within lists in Office 365. We’ll do all this using WebStorm, but you can use any text editor. You don’t have to have any experience with Office 365 APIs or Azure AD to participate in this workshop… you’ll learn how to do all of it!</p>\n\n<p>Pre-Requirements: To participate in building the application demonstrated in the workshop, you will need an Office 365 tenant as well as a Microsoft Azure subscription to build this application… you can create trials for these quickly, but you should do it ahead of time.</p>",

Concepts like multiple apps and tools on a single page can be imagined and architected without the use of iframes or plugins.\n\nThe session will begin by taking a look at a case study in which a new UX concept design led to the need to create one AngularJS app code base and the ability to spawn multiple instances of it on a single page.\n\nTo learn how to pull that off, we will walk through how to add and remove instances of AngularJS applications in the DOM on demand using the bootstrap method and discuss strategies around application cleanup during tear down. Then we will cover performance considerations and explore the concept of tombstoning an app as well as dive into ways to persist and restore application state as we spin up and wind down app instances.",

We'll identify the two major problems that make up &quot;callback hell&quot; (no, nothing to do with nesting/indentation!). </p>\n\n<p>Then, to clean up this mess, we'll look at two different ES6 mechanisms which each solve a different aspect of callback hell: generators and promises.

And then we'll see how to compose promises with generators for solid async. </p>\n\n<p>After gaining a firm grasp over these reinvented async methodologies, then we'll look some at higher-order async patterns, and learn ways of identifying when and where to apply them: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iterable sequences</li>\n<li>streams (reactive)</li>\n<li>CSP (channel-based concurrency)</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To wrangle all these different async abstractions, we'll practice the exercises with the &quot;asynquence&quot; library. </p>\n\n<p>Prerequistes: Day 1 &quot;Advanced JavaScript&quot; course, and/or 2-3 years of solid core JS experience.</p>",

Users want both, but sometimes the interplay between design and performance feels like a fixed sum game: one side's gain is the other side's loss. Design and performance are indeed connected, but it's more like the yin and yang. They aren't opposing forces, but instead complement each other. Users want an experience that is rich and fast. The trick for designers and developers is figuring out how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is to adopt an approach that considers both design and performance from the outset. With this approach, designs are conceived by teams of designers and developers working together. Developers benefit by participating in the product definition process. Designers benefit from understanding more about how designs are implemented. There's an emphasis on early prototyping and tracking performance from the get go.</p>\n\n      <p>With new metrics that focus on what a user actually sees as the page loads, we can now bridge the technical and language gaps that have hindered the seamless creation of great user experiences. In this presentation, Steve Souders, former Chief Performance Yahoo! and Google Head Performance Engineer, explains how promoting a process that brings design and performance together at the beginning of a project helps deliver a web experience that is both fast and rich.</p>\n",

Web applications are no longer being built to cater to human interaction, but now must adapt to be able to handle machine-to-machine communications. This new requirement has placed a dramatic emphasis on API interfaces and has even ushered in a new development methodology called API first development.\n\nAs a result, JavaScript has risen to the forefront as the ideal language due to its ability to perform under the high concurrency and event-driven I/O required by the multitude of devices being integrated onto the web. This rise in relevancy for JavaScript has, in turn, created a number of technologies that span the entire web application stack to provide the ideal platform to build the next generation of Web 3.0 applications. This web application stack is commonly referred to as the M.E.A.N stack and is more than just another web application framework. It is an answer to the glaring problem of web applications needing to support high concurrency requests from a multitude of devices, and serves as the ideal platform for what is being called Web 3.0.\n\nThis presentation will walk you through all the latest trends within Web Development and provide an in-depth introduction to the M.E.A.N architecture. In addition, we will walk through how to build a next generation, API-first, web application that is built for the future. ",
