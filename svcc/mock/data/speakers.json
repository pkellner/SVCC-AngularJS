        "description": "<p>Are you building Angular apps for enterprise customers? You likely need to talk to secured services, you need to lock down parts of your app and you need to maintain good application structure to name a few things. In this workshop we’ll build an enterprise Angular app from start to finish in TypeScript and secure sections of the app using Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. Well see how we can access a user’s mailbox to use their email, contacts and calendar that resides in Office 365. We’ll store files within the user’s OneDrive files. You’ll see how to store collaborative data within lists in Office 365. We’ll do all this using WebStorm, but you can use any text editor. You don’t have to have any experience with Office 365 APIs or Azure AD to participate in this workshop… you’ll learn how to do all of it!</p>\n\n<p>Pre-Requirements: To participate in building the application demonstrated in the workshop, you will need an Office 365 tenant as well as a Microsoft Azure subscription to build this application… you can create trials for these quickly, but you should do it ahead of time.</p>",

Then we will cover performance considerations and explore the concept of tombstoning an app as well as dive into ways to persist and restore application state as we spin up and wind down app instances.</p>",

        "description": "Building components that can stand the test of time is tough! Frameworks change, new fads emerge, and often we're left with an aging codebase that needs to be rewritten if we want to stay current. Polymer and Web Components aim to change this cycle by building on new platform primitives which will allow us to finally create interoperable components that work in an environment. In this session we'll look at the current Web Component ecosystem, and I'll show you how to start to integrate these tools into your projects.",

        "description": "<p>In this second day of our intensive course, we will dive deeply into the topic of asynchrony. First, we'll look at callbacks and see why they are functional but insufficient for managing async flow control in our complex modern applications. We'll identify the two major problems that make up &quot;callback hell&quot; (no, nothing to do with nesting/indentation!). </p>\n\n<p>Then, to clean up this mess, we'll look at two different ES6 mechanisms which each solve a different aspect of callback hell: generators and promises. We'll see that generators are about solving sync-looking async, while promises are about restoring trust to our continuations. And then we'll see how to compose promises with generators for solid async. </p>\n\n<p>After gaining a firm grasp over these reinvented async methodologies, then we'll look some at higher-order async patterns, and learn ways of identifying when and where to apply them: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iterable sequences</li>\n<li>streams (reactive)</li>\n<li>CSP (channel-based concurrency)</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To wrangle all these different async abstractions, we'll practice the exercises with the &quot;asynquence&quot; library. </p>\n\n<p>Prerequistes: Day 1 &quot;Advanced JavaScript&quot; course, and/or 2-3 years of solid core JS experience.</p>",

Users want both, but sometimes the interplay between design and performance feels like a fixed sum game: one side's gain is the other side's loss. Design and performance are indeed connected, but it's more like the yin and yang. They aren't opposing forces, but instead complement each other. Users want an experience that is rich and fast. The trick for designers and developers is figuring out how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is to adopt an approach that considers both design and performance from the outset. With this approach, designs are conceived by teams of designers and developers working together. Developers benefit by participating in the product definition process. Designers benefit from understanding more about how designs are implemented. There's an emphasis on early prototyping and tracking performance from the get go.</p>\n\n      <p>With new metrics that focus on what a user actually sees as the page loads, we can now bridge the technical and language gaps that have hindered the seamless creation of great user experiences. In this presentation, Steve Souders, former Chief Performance Yahoo! and Google Head Performance Engineer, explains how promoting a process that brings design and performance together at the beginning of a project helps deliver a web experience that is both fast and rich.</p>\n",

        "description": "The web is dramatically evolving. With the latest trend of the Internet of Things, there is a radical paradigm shift occurring in the web development community. Web applications are no longer being built to cater to human interaction, but now must adapt to be able to handle machine-to-machine communications. This new requirement has placed a dramatic emphasis on API interfaces and has even ushered in a new development methodology called API first development.\n\nAs a result, JavaScript has risen to the forefront as the ideal language due to its ability to perform under the high concurrency and event-driven I/O required by the multitude of devices being integrated onto the web. This rise in relevancy for JavaScript has, in turn, created a number of technologies that span the entire web application stack to provide the ideal platform to build the next generation of Web 3.0 applications. This web application stack is commonly referred to as the M.E.A.N stack and is more than just another web application framework. It is an answer to the glaring problem of web applications needing to support high concurrency requests from a multitude of devices, and serves as the ideal platform for what is being called Web 3.0.\n\nThis presentation will walk you through all the latest trends within Web Development and provide an in-depth introduction to the M.E.A.N architecture. In addition, we will walk through how to build a next generation, API-first, web application that is built for the future. ",

Angular does all of the heavy lifting for you to pave the road towards building a SPA. This workshop explores the core pieces that help you build end-to-end SPA solutions using Angular including code structure and modularity, using data binding and MV*, abstracted remote data calls, page navigation and routing, rich data features, and responsive design. Throughout the workshop, you’ll learn how to build robust SPA applications with Angular. You’ll see several focused demos and full-featured apps that will help you learn and understand the role of key Angular components such as modules, controllers, factories, directives, and more. &lt;/p&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&lt;p&gt;The workshop will also discuss new features coming in Angular 2.0 and the role that TypeScript will play.&lt;/p&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&lt;p&gt;This workshop covers: &lt;/p&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&lt;ul&gt;\n  <br />&#160; &lt;li&gt;SPA fundamentals &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Importance of Separation of Concerns (SoC) &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;JavaScript patterns for creating organized code &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Key components of AngularJS &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;How directives can be used &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;The role of views, controllers, and $scope &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Managing remote data calls using services&lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;The role of modules and how they can be used &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Routing and page navigation &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Data binding &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Navigating and app lifecycle &lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Debugging tips&lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;Preparing for Angular 2.0&lt;/li&gt; </p>\n\n<p>&#160; &lt;li&gt;TypeScript fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;\n  <br />&lt;/ul&gt;</p>",
